			 I'm a 4th year BAIS student on the IS track at the University of Iowa and if I decide to not persue an MBA right away I will apply for jobs in data analytics after I graduate in May.
			 My home town is the City of Cedar Rapids.
			 I grew up playing baseball and watching Netflix. My hobbies include hanging out with friends, working out, browsing reddit, and taking naps. The most import things to me are my friends and family.
